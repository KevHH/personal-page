## Dev
- [Collection of web dev tools](https://toolkit.addy.codes/) by Adam Greenough 
- [Bib cleaner](https://github.com/KevHH/bib_cleaner) by me </br>
   This is a script that replaces journal names in a `.bib` file with AMS-style abbreviations. Customisation is possible by a `.csv` file.
- [Script for parallelising jax over multiple Slurm nodes](https://github.com/KevHH/slurm_jax_multinode) by me </br> 
   This script is useful for an older version of `jax` where automatic detection of IP address in multiple slurm nodes is not yet available in `jax.distributed`.
