Through BfE Tech and personal projects, I dabble quite a bit in various aspects of software development and am still a keen follower of the ever-changing industry trends.

At the moment, I spend a fair bit of time with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) and [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) due to my role at BfE.

I picked up some dev skills in [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/) from two incredbie months at [LCP](https://www.lcp.uk.com/technology-analytics/), and built a PHP [site](https://hh457.user.srcf.net/mathmo-guide/) during my undergrad. I have some toy exposure to [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com). With ongoing projects in BfE Tech, I am getting slowly acquainted with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) among a bunch of other technical and management tools. 

This website is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindui.com/) hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

After all the excitement learning [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) and [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) from the amazing PhD training bootcamp with [Cajal](http://cajal-training.org/neurokit/experim-neuroscience/), I currently keep a laundry list of long-overdued electronic ideas that I dig into from time to time.

Some small tools I built are listed [here](/collection).
