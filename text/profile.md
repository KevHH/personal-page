I am a PhD candidate at the [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit at UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/), advised by [Peter Orbanz](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~porbanz/) and [Morgane Austern](https://sites.google.com/view/morganeaustern/) from the [Department of Statistics at Harvard University](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu). I study mathematical structures of large stochastic systems that emerge in machine learning settings, and the associated theory and algorithms for estimation, prediction and uncertainty quantification. I am particularly interested in settings where data are scarce, high-dimensional, and/or strongly correlated.

I organise the [Foundations and Landmarks reading group](https://foundations-landmarks.notion.site/) with [Max Hird](https://www.linkedin.com/in/max-hird-366a30b4/), a biweekly reading group based in London, reviewing foundational papers in probability and statistics. 

Prior to my PhD, I received my [Bachelor and Master in Mathematics](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/) from [Magdalene College](https://www.magd.cam.ac.uk/), [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/about-the-university). 

I was a visiting researcher at the [LIPS group at Princeton CS](https://lips.cs.princeton.edu/) advised by [Ryan P. Adams](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rpa/) for Spring 2024, where I worked on neural-network ansatzs for crystalline solids. 

I also do [nonprofit work, software development, and a bit of cooking](/non-maths) on the side.
